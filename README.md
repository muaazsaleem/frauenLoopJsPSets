# frauenLoop Javascript challenges
JS problem sets for the Frauenloop intro course

Chapters 8-11 of General Assemby fundamentals move through concepts of Javascript, pretty quickly. Feel free to stop after each section and complete these problem challenges.

1. Conditionals
2. Functions
3. Types

tip:
some of these challenges require you to accept input from a user - a quick way to do this is with a prompt:
`prompt("what value do you assign to x?"`
