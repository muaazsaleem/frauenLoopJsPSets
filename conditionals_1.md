## Conditionals I

### By the end ...
By the end of these challenges, you'd know how to use conditionals (if…else) in your programs. Yay!


*Don't forget to use good programming conventions by describing what your code does through comments and using descriptive names for variables in your JS programs.*

Problems:
At completion: Show your JS programs execution to the mentors.


```
A concert hall has three seating categories: Orchestra, Main floor, and Balcony. Orchestra seats are  
$25. Main floor seats are $30, and Balcony seats are $15. The manager wants a program that allows  
him to enter the number of tickets sold in each seating category. The program should calculate and  
display the amount of revenue generated by each seating category, as well as the total revenue.  
(a) Create an IPO chart for the problem, using a flowchart. (b) Then code the algorithm into a program.  
(c) Desk-check the algorithm/program twice. For the first desk-check, use 50, 100, and 75 as the number  
of Orchestra, Main floor, and Balcony seats. For the second desk-check, use 30, 25, and 99.

A program stores sales amounts in two double variables named marySales and jimSales. Write the JS code  
to assign the highest and lowest sales amounts to the highSales and lowSales variables, respectively,  
and then display the contents of those variables. (You can assume that both sales amounts are  
different.) Desk-check your program using some sample values.  
```


```
A program uses a char variable named department and two double variables named salary and raise. The  
department variable contains one of the following letters (entered in either uppercase or lowercase):  
A, B, or C. Employees in departments A and B are receiving a 2% raise. Employees in department C are  
receiving a 1.5% raise. Write the JS code to calculate and display the appropriate raise amount.  
Display the raise amount in fixed-point notation with two decimal places.  
```

```
Tea Time Company wants a program that allows a clerk to enter the number of pounds of tea ordered,  
the price per pound, and whether the customer should be charged a $15 shipping fee. The program  
should calculate and display the total amount the customer owes. Use an int variable for the number  
of pounds, a double variable for the price per pound, and a char variable for the shipping  
information. (a) Create an IPO chart for the problem, using a flowchart. (b) Then code the algorithm  
into a program. (c) Desk-check the algorithm/program twice. For the first desk-check, use 10 as the  
number of pounds and 12.54 as the price per pound; the customer should be charged the shipping fee.  
For the second desk-check, use 5 as the number of pounds and 11.59 as the price; the customer should  
not be charged the shipping fee.

A third-grade teacher at Plano Elementary School wants a program that allows a student to enter the  
amount of money a customer owes and the amount of money the customer paid. The program should calculate  
and display the amount of change, as well as how many dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies  
to return to the customer. Display an appropriate message when the amount paid is less than the amount  
owed. (a) Create an IPO chart for the problem, using a flowchart. (b) Then code the algorithm into a  
program. (c) Desk-check the algorithm/program twice. For the first desk-check, use 75.34 and 80 as the  
amount owed and paid, respectively. For the second desk-check, use 39.67 and 50. For the third  
desk-check, use 10.55 and 9.75. Display the change in fixed-point notation with two decimal places.  
Display the remaining output in fixed-point notation with no decimal places.
